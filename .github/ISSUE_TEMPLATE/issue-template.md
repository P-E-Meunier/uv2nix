<!--
Is this an issue in the style of "package "X fails to build"?

Most such issues aren't issues in uv2nix as such, but rather an incomplete dependency specification.
We don't have the capacity to act on most such issues, they often require domain knowledge and they generate noise in the issue tracker.

For general advice & guidance on build fixes see:
